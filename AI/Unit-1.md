# **INTRODUCTION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE – TOP-SCORING NOTES**

---

## **1. Definition of Artificial Intelligence**

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a branch of computer science that creates **machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence** such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.

AI = **Artificial (man-made) + Intelligence (thinking ability)**
AI exists when machines show **human-like skills**: learning from experience, adapting, solving problems, making decisions.

---

## **2. Why Artificial Intelligence?**

AI is important because it can:

* Solve real-world problems (healthcare, traffic, marketing, environment).
* Power virtual assistants (Siri, Google Assistant).
* Work in dangerous environments (mines, ocean, space).
* Enable new technologies like autonomous cars, smart robots, advanced analytics.
* Increase efficiency, speed, and accuracy in complex tasks.

---

## **3. Goals of Artificial Intelligence**

1. **Replicate human intelligence**
2. **Solve knowledge-intensive tasks**
3. **Link perception ↔ action rationally**
4. Build machines capable of tasks requiring human intelligence

   * Driving
   * Chess
   * Surgery planning
   * Theorem proving
5. Create systems that can learn, explain, advise, and adapt autonomously.

## **4. What Comprises Artificial Intelligence?**

AI requires many disciplines because intelligence involves:

* **Reasoning**
* **Learning**
* **Problem-solving**
* **Perception**
* **Language understanding**

Disciplines contributing to AI:

* **Mathematics**
* **Biology**
* **Psychology**
* **Sociology**
* **Computer Science**
* **Neuroscience**
* **Statistics**

---

## **5. Advantages of Artificial Intelligence**

* **High accuracy, fewer errors**
* **High speed**, faster decision-making
* **Highly reliable**; repeat tasks consistently
* Works in **risky areas** (bomb disposal, space, oceans)
* **Digital assistants** for automation
* Useful for **public utilities** (self-driving cars, facial recognition, NLP)

---

## **6. Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence**

* **High cost** (hardware, software, maintenance)
* **Cannot think creatively/outside the box**
* **No emotions or feelings**
* **Increased dependency** on machines
* **Lack of originality**—cannot match human creativity

## **7. History of Artificial Intelligence (Quick Timeline)**

**1943–1952 (Maturation):**

* 1943: McCulloch & Pitts – Artificial Neuron model
* 1949: Hebb – Hebbian learning
* 1950: Alan Turing – Turing Test

**1952–1956 (Birth of AI):**

* 1955: Logic Theorist (first AI program)
* 1956: Term “Artificial Intelligence” coined by John McCarthy

**1956–1974 (Golden Years):**

* 1966: First chatbot **ELIZA**
* 1972: First humanoid robot **Wabot-1**

**1974–1980 (First AI Winter):** Low funding, low interest.

**1980–1987 (AI Boom):** Expert systems became popular.

**1987–1993 (Second AI Winter):** Expert systems failed commercially.

**1993–2011 (Emergence of Intelligent Agents):**

* 1997: **Deep Blue** defeats chess champion Kasparov
* 2002: Roomba (AI vacuum)
* 2006: AI enters business world

**2011–Present (Deep Learning Era):**

* 2011: IBM Watson wins Jeopardy
* 2012: Google Now
* 2014: Eugene Goostman passes limited Turing test
* 2018: IBM Project Debater
* Google Duplex, autonomous cars, large language models

## **8. Types of AI (Two Major Classifications)**

### **A. Based on Capabilities**

1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**

   * Performs one specific task
   * Examples: Siri, Alexa, Chess engine, Speech recognition

2. **General AI**

   * Human-level intelligence
   * Can perform any intellectual task
   * Does not exist yet (under research)

3. **Super AI**

   * Surpasses human intelligence
   * Hypothetical; future concept
   * Can think, reason, plan better than humans

---

### **B. Based on Functionality**

1. **Reactive Machines**

   * No memory
   * Only respond to current input
   * Example: Deep Blue, AlphaGo

2. **Limited Memory**

   * Stores temporary data
   * Example: Self-driving cars

3. **Theory of Mind**

   * Understand emotions, beliefs, intentions
   * Still under research

4. **Self-Aware AI**

   * Has consciousness
   * Future concept; does not exist

# 1) Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

[cite_start]AI is a branch of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines that can **behave like a human**, **think like humans**, and are able to **make decisions**[cite: 2048].

### 1. Core Definition and Concept
* [cite_start]**Composition:** AI is composed of $\text{Artificial}$ ("man-made") and $\text{Intelligence}$ ("thinking power")[cite: 2046].
* [cite_start]**Core Skills:** AI machines possess human-based skills such as **learning**, **reasoning**, and **solving problems**[cite: 2049].
* [cite_start]**Programming:** Instead of preprogramming a machine for every task, AI involves creating a machine with programmed algorithms that enable it to work with its **own intelligence**[cite: 2050, 2051].

### [cite_start]2. Goals of AI 🎯 [cite: 2061]
1.  [cite_start]**Replicate human intelligence**[cite: 2062].
2.  [cite_start]**Solve Knowledge-intensive tasks**[cite: 2063].
3.  [cite_start]Achieve an intelligent **connection of perception and action**[cite: 2064].
4.  [cite_start]Build machines that perform tasks requiring human intelligence[cite: 2065], such as:
    * [cite_start]Proving a theorem[cite: 2067].
    * [cite_start]Playing chess[cite: 2068].
    * [cite_start]Driving a car in traffic[cite: 2070].
5.  [cite_start]Create systems that can **exhibit intelligent behavior**, learn new things by itself, and advise the user[cite: 2071].

### 3. Disciplines Comprising AI (The Foundation)
[cite_start]Intelligence is a combination of Reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding[cite: 2074]. [cite_start]To achieve this for machines, AI requires contributions from the following fields[cite: 2076]:
* [cite_start]**Mathematics** [cite: 2077]
* [cite_start]**Computer Science** [cite: 2081]
* [cite_start]**Psychology** [cite: 2079]
* [cite_start]**Philosophy** [cite: 2092]
* [cite_start]**Biology** [cite: 2078]
* [cite_start]**Neuron Science** (or Neurons Study) [cite: 2082]
* [cite_start]**Statistics** [cite: 2083]
* [cite_start]**Sociology** [cite: 2080]

### [cite_start]5. Types of AI (Classification) [cite: 2195]

AI is categorized into two main types based on **Capabilities (Type 1)** and **Functionality (Type 2)**.

#### Type 1: Based on Capabilities
| Type | Description | Current Status | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. [cite_start]Narrow AI** (Weak AI) [cite: 2210] | [cite_start]Able to perform a **dedicated task** with intelligence[cite: 2211]. [cite_start]Cannot perform beyond its limitations[cite: 2213]. | [cite_start]**Currently available** (We are here [cite: 2233][cite_start])[cite: 2212]. | [cite_start]Apple Siri [cite: 2215][cite_start], self-driving cars [cite: 2217][cite_start], purchasing suggestions[cite: 2217]. |
| **2. General AI** | [cite_start]Could perform **any intellectual task** with efficiency like a human[cite: 2219]. | [cite_start]**Under research**; no such system exists yet[cite: 2222, 2226]. | N/A |
| **3. [cite_start]Super AI** (Strong AI) [cite: 2227] | [cite_start]Machines surpass human intelligence and perform tasks **better than humans** with cognitive properties[cite: 2228, 2230]. | [cite_start]**Hypothetical concept** (Future of AI)[cite: 2231, 2256]. | N/A |

#### Type 2: Based on Functionality
| Type | Description | Functionality | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. [cite_start]Reactive Machines** [cite: 2239] | Most basic type. [cite_start]**Do not store memories** or past experiences[cite: 2240, 2241]. [cite_start]Focus only on current scenarios[cite: 2242]. | [cite_start]Purely reactive[cite: 2240]. | [cite_start]IBM's Deep Blue [cite: 2244][cite_start], Google's AlphaGo[cite: 2245]. |
| **2. [cite_start]Limited Memory** [cite: 2246] | [cite_start]Can store **past experiences for a short period of time**[cite: 2246, 2247]. Uses stored data to inform current actions. | [cite_start]Stores data temporarily[cite: 2247]. | [cite_start]Self-driving cars (store recent speed, distance of nearby cars)[cite: 2248, 2249]. |
| **3. [cite_start]Theory of Mind** [cite: 2250] | [cite_start]Should understand **human emotions**, beliefs, and be able to interact socially[cite: 2251]. | [cite_start]Understands human psychology[cite: 2251]. | [cite_start]Still under research[cite: 2252]. |
